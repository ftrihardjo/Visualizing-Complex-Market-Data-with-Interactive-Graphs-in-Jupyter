# Visualizing Complex Market Data with Interactive Graphs in Jupyter

First, set up a virtual environment and install the necessary libraries listed in requirements.txt. The dataset will be obtained through Yahoo! Finance's API using the **yfinance** Python library. After executing all the cells in the notebook sequentially, a dashboard will appear at the bottom cell. Input the desired ticker(s), along with the start and end dates, and then click the **Fetch Data** button. If you omit any dates, the data from the last five years will be retrieved. Press the **Show Trends** button to visualize the time series of the adjusted closing prices of the ticker(s) as line graphs. Use the **Show Correlations** button to generate a correlation matrix for the returns of the ticker(s). Finally, click on the **Risk vs Return** button to view the annualized volatility against the annualized return for each of the ticker(s).
